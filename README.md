An easy to play, offline version of Scopa that plays well on your smartphone in portrait mode. It's just you versus your CPU.

No adds and no special permission requirements! 

To install on your device, go to https://girumsam174.github.io/Scopa/ then go to your browser's menu and click add to homescreen.

My testing environment is an older Samsung smartphone, so your mileage may vary, but it should work on iOS as well.
